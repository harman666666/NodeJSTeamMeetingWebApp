# TeamMeetR
Web application prototype that enables users to post daily scrum meeting notes which can be viewed by teammates.  Useful for when teammates cannot be physically present at meetings. 

TeamMeetR was built with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.  It has a simple Swig UI that will be updated later to a ReactJS client.

To run web application, install dependencies by typing "npm install", and then to start the server type "npm start"
